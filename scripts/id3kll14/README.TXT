HeadStrong ID3KILL
Audio Utility (Windows 95/98/NT/2000/ME), MP3 tag remover.


Long Description
----------------

ID3 is a general tagging format for audio, which makes it
possible to store meta data (album, year, genre, ...) about 
the song inside the audio file itself.

This freeware tool removes and lists ID3v1 & ID3v2 tags 
from MP3 files.

This is useful if you encounter incorrect tags in your MP3
files or if you wish to upgrade the tags in your files. 
ID3KILL has the option of only removing ID3v1 or ID3v2 tags
should you wish to preserve one of the two, and can recursively
search within subdirectories if you want total annihilation. 

ID3KILL can even modify files marked 'read-only', provided
the storage medium allows it. Simple, easy, removes ID3 tags
within a few clicks!

The new version adds an option to clean up M3U and PLS
playlists, removing title and length information (EXTINF).
This saves another few kbytes of hard disk space.
For more details see included HTML documentation.
